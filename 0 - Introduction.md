# ðŸŽ‰ Welcome to the Node.js Course by **Anurag "The Handsome" Bansal**!

ðŸ‘‹ **Hello There!**
In this course, you'll learn almost everything you need to start building your own web applications using Node.js. Now, let me tell you a little secret: **most stuff in programming is learned by doing**. This course sets you up, but you only understand it with your own core when you do it yourself!

### **ðŸŒŸ What is Node.js?**
At its core, Node.js is just **JavaScript** with a runtime environment.
Basically, JavaScript is typically used to make websites interactive and runs **only** inside a browser. But with Node.js, JavaScript escapes the browser and runs on your **console**, just like any other programming language!

About Node.js:
ðŸŸ¢ **Beginner-friendly**: A great choice for your first language to get a feel for coding.
ðŸŸ¢ **Free to install**: No fancy hardware neededâ€”just your device and a little curiosity!
ðŸŸ¢ **File extension**: `.js`

## **ðŸ“¥ How to Install Node.js**

### **Windows**
Head over to the [official Node.js website](https://nodejs.org) and follow the simple instructions to get started.

### **Linux/MacOS**
Use [Node Version Manager (nvm)](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#installing-and-updating). It's quick, easy, and comes with clear setup instructions.

### **Android**
Android doesn't natively support Node.js, but that's no problem. Just install the `Termux`, a terminal emulator from [F-Droid](https://f-droid.org/en/packages/com.termux/), then run these commands:
```bash
pkg update
pkg install nodejs
```

### **iOS**
iOS is a bit trickier, but you can use an Alpine Linux emulator. Once installed, run:
```bash
apk update
apk add nodejs npm
```

And that's about it, you have node.js installed and know what it is! Next topic: **Getting Started.md**
