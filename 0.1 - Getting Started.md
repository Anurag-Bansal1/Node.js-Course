**Starting up, we need a little more setup, here's the guide:**

## **💻 Choose Your Tools**

You'll need a code editor or IDE (Integrated Development Environment) to write your Node.js scripts. Here are your options:
- 🖊️ **Plain text editor**: Keep it simple. This is where I started, and it's great for learning the basics.
- 🎨 **[Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/Download)**: The go-to choice for Windows, Linux, and MacOS.
- 📱 **Code Editor**:
	- [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.rhmsoft.code&hl=en_IN)
	- [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/code-editor-compiler-ide/id1581290510)

*Pro tip*: Transitioning from a text editor to an IDE feels amazing—like unlocking a superpower for your coding!

## **👨‍💻 Your First Program**

1. Create a file named `myFirstCode.js`.
2. Add this code:
	```js
	console.log("Hello World");
	```
3. Open your terminal:
	- **VS Code**: Click on *Terminal > New Terminal*.
	- **Termux**: Just open the app.
	- **Alpine Linux**: Launch the emulator.
4. Run your code:
	```bash
	node myFirstCode.js
	```

🎉 *Boom! You just wrote your first Node.js program!*

It didn't do anything fancy, `console.log()` just prints whatever we input in the console but it's a great start!
